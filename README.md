**The Problem**
The management of bulletin boards around the campus are a mess. It's difficult to manage, thus only cleaned up one a semester. 
Our solution will provide a visual representation of each bulletin board, instead of a messy google doc list that only has names and organizations. In addition to that, the solution will also provide a way to authorize each poster without having to manually stamp every poster. 

**Two or Three Existing Solutions**
There is no specific website or tech that aims to solve our problem right now, however a couple of solutions were attempted. One solution that was tried was having work-study students manual go around the campus and check every bulletin board for posters. Another solution that was tried was compiling things into google drive. Both solutions are ineffective and difficult to manage. Thus, neither solution are in effect right now. 

**Plan on finding the target population**
We're sure the SUNY Korea student service team would be on board to find a solution to managing the bulletin board. We can email them or visit them in person. We can also reach out to GMU, Ghent, Utah and IGC to see if they are also will to participate. 
We are also well connected with several club executives that would be more than willing to participate. 
Everyone mentioned can be reached in person, though email, or on Kakaotalk.
