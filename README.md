**The Problem**  
The management of bulletin boards around the campus are a mess. It's difficult to manage, thus are only cleaned up once a semester and often posters for an event at the start of the semester are left there until the end of the semester.  
Our solution will provide a visual representation of each bulletin board, instead of a messy google doc list that only has names and organizations. In addition, the solution will also provide a way to authorize each poster online thus eliminating the need to set an appointment with student affairs to meet in person and to manually stamp every poster. 

**Two or Three Existing Solutions**  
There is no specific website or app that aims to solve our problem right now, however a couple of solutions were attempted. One solution that was tried was having work-study students manually go around the campus and check every bulletin board for posters. Another solution that was tried was compiling things into google drive. Both solutions are ineffective and difficult to manage. Thus, neither solution is in effect right now. 

**Plan on finding the target population**  
We're sure that SUNY Korea student service team would be on board to find a solution to managing the bulletin boards. We can email them or visit them in person. We can also reach out to GMU, Ghent, Utah and IGC to see if they are also will to participate.  
We are also well connected with several club executives and other student learders like Residential Assistants and Student Ambassadors who need to put posters on bulletin board and would be more than willing to participate.  
Everyone mentioned can be reached in person, though email, or on Kakaotalk.
